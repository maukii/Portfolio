			<h3>Fast Flare</h3>
			<p>Free to play arcade themed mobile game created with Unreal Engine 4.</p>
			<p>My role in this project was a gameplay programmer. I created the movement system the player is using and added some camera smoothing and zooming. After that I focused on optimization. <br><br>

			<h3>Sabreurs A Noble Duel</h3>
			<p>Sabreurs - A Noble Duel is a local 2-player fencing game about two noblemen settling their disagreement. Maybe someone insulted the other's mother, wronged their family or doubted their noble upbringings. But that doesn't matter - for it is time to settle this by a duel!</p>
			<p>In this project I created the player controller system, created an audio controller and handled menus in the game. <br><br>

			<h3>Fantastic Train</h3>
			<p>The objective of the game is to keep your passengers safe and get the train to the next station! There is 3 different types of enemies that the players will encounter on their trips. Players are able to upgrade their train with better guns and 3 different types of fuel ores only if they perform well on their journeys.</p>
			<p>In Fantastic Train I created the player input system, an audio controller, and did some of the enemy AIs seen in the game.<br><br>

			<h3>The Lost Spring</h3>
			<p>The story of the game can be red from the main menu of our game. This gamejam project was created with 2 programmers and a single graphics artist during 42hours spring game jam event. We had time to create 2 different game modeds. There is a story mode for the game which has fixed levels and endless mode that will procedurally generate more level for the player and the camera will eventually catch up.</p>
			<p>My role in this team was to create the gameplay part which includes the jumping of the player, players animations and the jump boost bar to jump higher. I used playerprefs to save the best score on endless mode.<br><br>
				Complete game can be found in: <a href="asdasd 123">Github repo link</a></p>
