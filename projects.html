				<p class="anim">Free to play arcade themed mobile game created with Unreal Engine 4.</p>

				<h1 class="anim">Sabreurs A Noble Duel</h1>
				<p class="anim">Sabreurs - A Noble Duel is a local 2-player fencing game about two noblemen settling their disagreement. Maybe someone insulted the other's mother, wronged their family or doubted their noble upbringings. But that doesn't matter - for it is time to settle this by a duel!</p>
				<p class="anim">In this project I created the player controller system, created an audio controller and handled menus in the game. <br><br>

There is 3 different types of enemies that the players will encounter on their trips. Players are able to upgrade their train with better guns and 3 different types of fuel ores only if they perform well on their journeys.</p>

				<h1 class="anim">The Lost Spring</h1>
				<p class="anim">The story of the game can be red from the main menu of our game. This gamejam project was created with 2 programmers and a single graphics artist during 42hours spring game jam event. We had time to create 2 different game modeds. There is a story mode for the game which has fixed levels and endless mode that will procedurally generate more level for the player and the camera will eventually catch up.</p>
				<p class="anim">My role in this team was to create the gameplay part which includes the jumping of the player, players animations and the jump boost bar to jump higher. I used playerprefs to save the best score on endless mode.<br><br>
					Complete game can be found in: <a href="asdasd 123">Github repo link</a></p>

				<h1 class="anim">Supliments For The Lords</h1>
				<p class="anim">The main objective of the game is to get the correct pills and bring them to your lord. You can throw the pill at your enemy to make them fly and drop the pill they are carrying. It's possible to make the other players lord angry by giving them a wrong pill. The game requires controllers to be played.</p>
				<p class="anim">I created most of the gameplay part in this gamejam project. I creted the pick-up and throwing mechanics and the audio manager. I also created the controller input system (first time working with conrollers).<br><br>
