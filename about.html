		<center><h2>Hi! I'm Mauno Kiiskinen, and i'm a game programmer and a student at Kajaani University Of Applied Sciences</h2></center>

		<h3>What have I done and what do I do?</h3>		
		<p>I have mostly worked on school projects as a gameplay programmer. There are many projects that can be seen on the <a href="file:///C:/Users/Mauno/Desktop/Portfolio/projects.html">projects tab</a>, but also many that are not shown can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/maukii?tab=repositories">Github</a>. I have been learning mostly about programming syntax in C# and also using different game engines as Unity and Unreal Engine 4.</p>

		<p>I'm currently studying using procedural generations and data structures in games. I'm also interested in creating my own  tools to help develop games more easily. My inspirational games have been The Binding Of Isaac and Spelunky.
